    "- Like finding friend groups in a social network\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Optimize**\n",
    "- Try moving cells between groups\n",
    "- Keep changes that improve \"modularity\" (within-group connections)\n",
    "- Stop when no improvement possible\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Leiden (not K-means)?**\n",
    "- K-means assumes spherical clusters (rare in biology)\n",
    "- Leiden works on the graph (more flexible)\n",
